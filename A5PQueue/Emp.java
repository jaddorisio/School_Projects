package A5PQueue;
// Program Description:  The program will implement a Priority Queue based on a Heap based on a linked Binary Tree
// File name: Emp.java
// File description: This is an Employee class that implements Comparable by contatining the compareTo() method
//      so that two Employees can be compared during the PriorotyQueue processing.

// Java Files in this program:  
// Provided by professor: Emp, BTNode, BinaryTree, BinaryTreeException,
//                        PromotionPointsSystem, 2 testers
// Written by student: Heap, PriorityQueue
